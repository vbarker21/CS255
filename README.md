Brief Summary of the DriverPass Project:
The DriverPass project aimed to design a comprehensive system for driver training. The client, Liam, sought a system providing online classes, practice tests, and on-the-road training to prepare students for driving tests.

What Did You Do Particularly Well?
In the business requirements document, I effectively outlined the client's needs, identifying key features such as account management, online scheduling, and integration with the DMV. In the system design document, 
I successfully translated these requirements into a coherent and user-friendly system architecture.

If You Could Choose One Part to Revise, What Would You Pick?
If I were to revise one part, I would enhance the clarity of certain technical details in the system design document. Clearer technical explanations would facilitate better understanding, 
ensuring seamless communication within the development team.

How Did You Interpret the User’s Needs and Implement Them?
I interpreted user needs by conducting a thorough analysis of the client's requirements, emphasizing accessibility, ease of use, and security. I implemented these needs in the system design through 
features like a user-friendly interface, secure login, and interactive learning modules.

Why Is It Important to Consider the User’s Needs?
Considering user needs is paramount because the success of any system hinges on user satisfaction. A system designed with the end-user in mind ensures usability, efficiency, and overall positive user experience.

How Do You Approach Designing Software?
My approach involves a meticulous analysis of requirements, understanding user needs, and translating them into a coherent system design. 
Techniques include creating detailed diagrams (UML), employing structured design principles, and ensuring scalability and adaptability.

What Techniques or Strategies Would You Use in the Future?
In the future, I would continue employing techniques like UML diagrams for visual clarity. Additionally, I'd focus on regular feedback loops with stakeholders to ensure evolving needs are addressed promptly. 
Embracing agile methodologies would enhance flexibility and responsiveness throughout the design process.
